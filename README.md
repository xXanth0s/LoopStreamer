## CAUTION

### Beta
Loopstreamer is still in beta, so the application may still contain bugs.


### Exclusion of liability
It is illegal to stream series or films for which you do not own the rights of use. 
Therefore, LoopStreamer only allows you to stream series of which you own an original copy. 
The developers of LoopStreamer distance themselves from any further use of the application.
